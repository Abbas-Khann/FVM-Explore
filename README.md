## 🤷‍♀️ Question Time

### 👨‍🔬 What is this and what was this built for?

FVM-Explore was built for the purpose of improving the developer experience on the FVM Chains, For FVM to be used and adopted widely the developer experience has to improve, And FVM-Explore was built with the same goal. Not only does it improve the deployment, interaction and verification process but it also allows developers to build applications on top of FVM-Explore using the apis that it provides.

## 🤔 Why FVM-Explore?

Interaction with contracts on FVM is difficult on it's own and FVM-Explore not only allows developers to interact with thier smart contracts but it also allows developers to deploy and verify their smart contracts with a very easy to use User interface. And if that were'nt enough it also allows developers to build on top of FVM-Explore using the Apis that it provides.

--> APIs for developers 👇

- Compiler to compile the code

- Verifier to verify the contract code

- Get ContractData for the contract
